# thetime
## Simple Rust library for time
- builds on top of std, chrono and time
- very simple and intuitive to use
- wraps some very useful functions that are usually buried deep in modules
- has extensive support for unusual epochs
- Fully supports without overflow, as the core data is stored as `u64`s, times since 01-01-1601, and up to, in my testing, "a+262143-01-01

## Features
### ntp
- Default: `true`
- includes: `Ntp` struct
## Which traits you need
```rust
// Basic functionality
use thetime::{System, Ntp, Time};

// Diff functions
use thetime::{System, Ntp, Time, TimeDiff};

// String direct strptime
use thetime::{System, Ntp, Time, StrTime};

// Timestamp int conversion
use thetime::{System, Ntp, Time, IntTime}

// Timezones
use thetime::Tz;
```
